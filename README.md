# YelpReviewDataAnalysis
This project is an analysis of publically-available data from Yelp’s Businesses and Reviews dataset. The analysis was performed utilizing a Spark Cluster through Amazon Web Service’s EMR and connected to a Jupyter Notebook, which was created to run queries against the dataset. All necessary libraries are installed and imported at the beginning of the Analysis.ipynb file. In order to successfully replicate the results of this project, please ensure that you create a EMR Spark Cluster using Relase: emr-5.31.0 and select Hadoop 2.10.1, Hive 2.3.0, Hue 4.10.0, Spark 2.4.8 and Livy 0.7.1 from the Software Configuration options.
